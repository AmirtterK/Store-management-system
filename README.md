# store-management-system
this is a simple store management system using C language ( cars dealership )

the project is fully written in C language, when you open the application it will open in full screen mode for the best possible experience
if it doesn't and you have to adjust it you may face some issues when it comes to accessing some items in the store

in order to move between the items and software options you have to use the arrow keys and 'enter' to access that item/option
you can always press 'esc' key to return to the previous page
when you buy items, a receipt.txt file will be created that contains all of the purchased items, you can't pick the same item twice since only 
item is unique in the store

everything else is explained in the header file in the form of comments

don't hesitate to contact me to infome me about any bugs/errors in the application
